# pair_processed_files

This repo was used to pair a maximum of files from the unsegmented and segmented file sets of the Tibetan oral corpus that was created at Esukhia.
The files were segmented and the transcription was adjusted where necessary.
The pairs found are in the three log files in the output folder.
